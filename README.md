# AI-POWERED POTATO DISEASE DETECTION AND INTELLIGENT STORAGE SORTING SYSTEM                                                                                              
Potato is a world's fourth most consumed staple food. Furthermore, global demand for potatoes is increasing day-by-day. However, potato diseases are the leading cause of harvest quality and quantity declines. With the enhancement in agricultural technology and the use of artificial intelligence in diagnosing plant diseases, it becomes important to make pertinent research to sustainable agricultural development. These leaf diseases are quite time-taking and cumbersome. Therefore, in this research, hardware-software interfacing system uses object detection & classification technique by using deep learning models. Further based on the detection & classification, the segregation is done for smart storage system.
